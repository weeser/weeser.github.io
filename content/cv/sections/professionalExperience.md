					<li>CSUSM subaward (2017) – This subaward is to extend the Data Explorer on physport.org to allow educators to create and analyze custom assessments. This will provide an easy to use interface to let researchers to examine their experimental assessments and allow departments to input and share data about their classes.</li>
					<li>Capability Inference based on Dynamic Topic Modeling and Text Information Extraction (2016 – 2017) – Co-system architect with responsibilities such as system design, data extraction, modeling, and integration, as well as training and supervising undergraduate researchers in machine learning and text analytics for a project funded through Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories.</li>
					<li>NSF WIDER (2013 – 2016) – Lead developer and in charge of supervising and training undergraduate researchers for a web application known as the Data Explorer with the American Association for Physics Teachers (AAPT). The Data Explorer is an analytics portal that gives educators the ability to gain insights from assessment data, using online information retrieval and visualization through a federated display. This creates a streamlined process for users to upload assessment data to explore.  The overall objective of this project is to let educators from all levels (high school, undergraduate, graduate, etc.) to interact with their data and anonymous summaries of data from other instructors in a usable, efficient, and secure way that has previously been a tedious, and sometimes impossible, task.  The focus of this research is to facilitate importing, validating, integrating, and visualizing assessment data.  This will be expanded for custom assessments, as well as other academic areas, such as computer science, in the future.</li>
